# Using

On your management machine:
```
doas pkg_add ansible

cd mastodon_openbsd
cp hosts.example hosts
...modify hosts file. adding your instance name, etc...
ansible-playbook site.yml
/var/www/_mastodon/cmd_runner.sh secrets >> .env.production
```

# Assumptions

* Target machine is a *FRESH* install. If it isn't your configurations might get whacked!
* Target machine has a large amount of RAM (Test instance has 8G).
* Remote host has Python 2.7 installed (`pkg_add -z python-2.7`).
* Remote host is running OpenBSD-current (snapshots).
* /var has enough space for the entire Mastodon install (~250M).
* `instance_name` is the FQDN of your desired Mastodon instance.
